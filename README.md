**This project demonstrates setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a React application using AWS services such as AWS CodeStar for project management and AWS CodePipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment process. Additionally, the deployment is orchestrated using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).**

Overview
The project utilizes the following AWS services:

AWS CodeStar: For project creation, management, and collaboration. AWS CodePipeline: For automating the CI/CD pipeline. Terraform: For infrastructure provisioning and deployment. Prerequisites Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources. Terraform installed locally. (Installation Guide) Node.js and npm installed for React application development. Setup Clone the Repository:

bash Copy code git clone <repository_url> cd <repository_directory> Install Dependencies:

Copy code npm install AWS CodeStar Setup:

Follow the instructions to create a new AWS CodeStar project for your React application. Configure AWS CodePipeline:

Set up a new pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, configuring the source, build, and deployment stages as required. Terraform Setup:

Ensure you have AWS credentials set up locally (either via ~/.aws/credentials or environment variables). Navigate to the terraform directory. Initialize Terraform: csharp Copy code terraform init Deployment:

Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform: Copy code terraform apply Usage Development:

Make changes to your React application code. Test locally. Commit changes and push to the configured Git repository. CI/CD Pipeline:

AWS CodePipeline will automatically trigger on code changes. Pipeline stages will execute: source, build, and deployment. Monitor the pipeline in the AWS Management Console for status and logs. Customization Pipeline Configuration:

Modify the AWS CodePipeline configuration (buildspec.yml) to customize the build and deployment process. Infrastructure:

Adjust the Terraform configuration (terraform/*.tf) to customize AWS resources and deployment settings. Cleanup To avoid ongoing charges, ensure to clean up the AWS resources:

Destroy Infrastructure:

Copy code terraform destroy Delete AWS CodeStar Project:

Navigate to AWS CodeStar dashboard and delete the project. Troubleshooting Refer to AWS documentation for troubleshooting AWS CodeStar, AWS CodePipeline, and Terraform-related issues.
